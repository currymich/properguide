    <h5>Community Outreach Opportunity<br> <span>Special Needs Clinic Day - Non CE</span></h5>
    <p>Registered dentists will assist the local community by helping perform cleanings, fillings, and extractions for special needs individuals. These patients are often not able to maintain proper oral hygiene and need extensive restorative work. Due to difficulties in treatment and insuring these patients, dental work is often neglected as well. This volunteer opportunity is a chance to give back and help those most in need.</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART)</h6>
      <p>There are multiple situations in which we dentists would love to put down the hand piece, as it is associated with pain and anxiety for many patients. This is particularly true for children and patients with
      special needs but also for adults with dental anxiety or for elderly patients. ART, originally developed for
      use in rural or resource-poor areas without access to the equipment necessary for traditional tooth filling,
      is a method of hand instrumentation only to remove carious tooth structure followed by filling with glass
      ionomer cement. Researchers from the Netherlands, Brazil, and New Zealand looked at the mineral
      concentration, with micro CT, of dentin treated with either ART, ultraconservative protocols (managing
      open cavities with a toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste), or conventional restorative treatment. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408818">They found
      that the dentin under ART restorations was hypermineralized</a>, with no statistical difference between the
      dentin density in this protocol compared to conventional restorative treatment. They also found statistical
      improvement in density from ultraconservative protocols compared to non-treated carious lesions. [1]</p>

      <h6 class="heading">A newly validated Smile Aesthetics Satisfaction Scale (SASS)</h6>
      <p>You may find that patients cannot readily articulate what they like and don’t like about their natural teeth or
      about aesthetic work done in your office. Researchers in Croatia developed and validated a simple scale
      that performed well for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29417573">assessing patient satisfaction with their smile aesthetics.</a> They simply rate on a
      scale of one to three (1 = not satisfied, 2 = moderately satisfied, 3 = completely satisfied) how satisfied
      they are with their tooth appearance, color, shape, position/alignment, and gingiva appearance. [2]</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Personalized medicine in dentistry</h6>
      <p>Omics profiling and personalized medicine are major buzz words in the medical field right now. So, why not dentistry? Omics profiling encompasses cytomics (the study of cell signaling biology), genomics (genome mapping), proteomics (the study of proteins), metabolomics (the study of metabolites), transcriptomics (the study of RNA transcripts), and so on and so forth. Researchers at Queen Mary University of London reviewed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410240">the current status of omics profiling in dentistry</a>, concluding that this is an emerging and promising field.

      <h6 class="heading">Caries prevention by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases</h6>
      <p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes in the protease family that degrade proteins in the extracellular matrix. MMPs are present in saliva, dentin, and odontoblasts and have been long shown to play a role in breaking down the organic matrix in teeth. It was originally thought that bacterial proteases were responsible for the destruction of tooth structure in cariogenesis, but evidence is mounting that the host’s MMPs are more to blame, with the low pH caused by bacterial metabolism of sugars activating the MMPs from their pro-form to their active form. Researchers from Beijing set out to determine whether blocking the host’s MMP activity using a chemically modified tetracycline-3 (CMT-3) would decrease the caries activity. They did find, using a well-designed study in rats fed a cariogenic diet, that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408826">rats treated with CMT-3 had significantly lower dentin caries than the control rats</a> (33.3% compared to 70.8%), while caries in the enamel was unaffected by the treatment.[4]</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Nanoparticles steered by magnetic forces to treat the injured pulp</h6>
      <p>Pulp injury from trauma or caries typically leads to necrosis. In order to treat the pulp to maintain tooth viability, the hard tissue has to be penetrated. Researchers from primarily the University of Maryland are working on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408655">a new nanomagnetic-mediated drug delivery system to treat the injured pulp by traveling through the dentinal tubules.</a>[5] Intrigued by the application of nanomaterials in dentistry? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29417862">Here</a> is a review on the state of the technology in the dental field.[6]</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Topical treatments to prevent BRONJ</h6>
      <p>Patients on bisphosphonate medications, such as zoledronate, face a serious dilemma when a tooth becomes non-restorable.  Researchers from the Dental College of Georgia in Agusta studied whether a topical chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) could help remove zoledronate bound to the bone matrix at the extraction site leading to better healing. In an in vitro study and a split mouth study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408511">in zoledronate-treated rats, they found the mucosal healing to be significantly improved after extractions on the EDTA treated sides.</a>[7] Of course, the best way to fight BRONJ is prevention. Researchers in Spain found (in a cohort of 255 cancer patients) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29412504">preventive dental care prior to zoledronate treatment led to 97% BRONJ free survival at 3 years</a>, which is significantly better than 66% in the group with dental treatment initiated after the onset of zoledronate therapy.[8]</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Cemented and Screw-Retained Implant Crowns Both Pass the Test</h6>
      <p>Many providers have a strong preference for screw-retained versus cement-retained implant crowns. Researchers from Shanghai worked on getting some data to support one technique over the other. They found some screw loosening and significantly higher peri-implant mucositis in the screw-retained group, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29401469">no statistical difference in peri-implantitis, pocket depths, modified plaque index, marginal bone loss, or implant survival rates.</a> [9]</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Patients who brush their teeth more have lower risk for metabolic syndrome</h6>
      <p>As we know, periodontal disease is associated with poorer cardiovascular health. The new finding by researchers from Japan this month is that, in a retrospective cohort of 3722 patients, frequent daily tooth brushing was an independent predictor of the odds of developing metabolic syndrome, even after adjusting for presence of periodontal disease, a potential confounder. They defined metabolic syndrome as obesity, elevated triglycerides, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and reduced high-density lipoprotein. While this study does not establish causality, it does establish that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29421856">patients who brush their teeth once per day or less have higher odds of developing metabolic syndrome. </a> [10]  </p>

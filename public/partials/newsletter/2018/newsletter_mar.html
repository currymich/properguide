    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Plasma-Rich Fibrin (PRF) Membrane for Closure of Oroantral Fistula</h6>
      <p>We tell every patient who gets a posterior maxillary tooth extracted that there is a small chance of oroantral communication. Researchers from Turkey studied whether this complication can be treated using PRF Membrane. In oroantral fistulas of 5mm or less, the researchers placed and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485557">sutured PRF into the sockets and found 100% full epithelialization without relapse.</a> [1]</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy for Pericoronitis</h6>
      <p>As it is often not feasible to extract teeth at initial presentation for pericoronitis, an effective treatment in the short term is very helpful. Researchers in Turkey compared photodynamic therapy and antibiotics to antibiotic therapy alone. They used indocyanine green activated by an 810 nm wavelength diode laser for the treatment group. They measured pain by self-report scale, lymphadenopathy, and biopsies for inflammatory cell analysis taken at baseline and at 3 days after initiation of treatment (at which point the tooth was also extracted). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29486353">They found that pain, lymphadenopathy, and inflammation were all improved in the photodynamic therapy group compared to antibiotic therapy alone. </a>[2]</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Non-invasive management of Initial Stage Interproximal Caries</h6>
      <p>The goal is always to preserve tooth structure and drill only where necessary. Researchers in Denmark and Brazil checked for bacteria presence in the dentin of teeth with different radiographic classifications of caries severity to determine criteria for necessity of intervention. Using the International Caries Classification and Management System (ICCMS) they scored interproximal lesions radiographically as either being in initial stages (radiolucency in enamel or limited to the outer 1/3 of dentin), moderate stages (radiolucency reaching the middle 1/3 of dentin), or extensive stages (radiolucency reaching the inner 1/3 of dentin or into the pulp, or clinically cavitated). Bacterial colonies were tested for in dentin biopsies collected with a sterile bur at the DEJ. They found bacteria in only 3 out of 29 or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484911">10% of the initial stage lesions while 86% and 100% of the moderate and extensive lesions had bacteria in the dentin</a> respectively.[3]</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Counseling Patients to Avoid Sugar-Sweetened Beverages</h6>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, all evidence still points to the fact that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484192">sugar-sweetened beverages are bad for children’s health</a>, according to researchers from Harvard’s School of Public Health. The negative health effects include obesity/overweight, dental caries, insulin resistance, and caffeine-related effects.[4]</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Phasing Out Amalgams</h6>
      <p>It is important to be aware of all the latest in controversial topics in dentistry. Norway and Sweden have already banned amalgams. Researchers from Norway site the health impacts of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29482185">mercury exposure in dental personnel </a>as a factor to be strongly considered in this argument. Food for thought.[5]</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">3D Printing in Endodontics</h6>
      <p>Go digital! While the researchers from the US Air Force Postgraduate Dental School mostly found that research was lacking in this area (heavily weighted towards case reports and pre-clinical studies), they did find the literature documented some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29486052">useful applications for 3D printing in Endodontics</a>. Some examples included “guided access with pulp canal obliteration, applications in autotransplantation, pre-surgical planning and educational modeling and accurate location of osteotomy perforation sites.”[6]</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Controlled-release Systems for Fluoride Toothpaste</h6>
      <p>Xerostomia-induced caries and other causes of high caries risk lead to frustration of patients and dentists alike. So, why not find ways to strengthen teeth by keeping fluoride in contact with the tooth structure for longer? Researchers from Brazil tested the fluoride retention in the oral cavity of various fluoride dentifrices with and without hydrocolloid (tara gum), in a triple-blind randomized crossover trial with washout. They found that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484546">dentifrice with fluoride and tara gum allowed for controlled-release of fluoride</a> up to 12 hours after brushing.[7] For some new insights into the anti-caries mechanisms of fluoride, read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29482049">here</a>.[8]</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Risk Factors Associated with Implant Failure</h6>
      <p>Canadian researchers studied a 10-year follow-up of 1087 anodized implants to determine survival rates and factors associated with failure and soft tissue health. They found a 97% survival rate and that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485463">implants in the maxilla as well as shorter implants were significantly more likely to fail</a>. On average, the marginal bone loss in a decade was under 1mm. Immediate loading did not affect survival. [9]</p>

      <h6 class="heading">How to Plan for Successful Implant Placement in the Maxillary Esthetic Zone</h6>
      <p>Implants in the maxillary esthetic zone have the potential to greatly improve quality of life. However, they also have the potential to create a very unhappy patient if the esthetics are off. For this reason, it is a good idea to do your homework when planning for this procedure. In this month’s issue of Periodontology 2000, researchers give a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484714">review of the literature </a>as well as wisdom from their clinical experience to make their recommendations. A few highlights are that immediate placement is a great procedure with potential for good esthetics and patient satisfaction, but it is technique sensitive and requires experience. Immediate loading is feasible in infected sites. A shoulder-less abutment should be used to allow space for the tissue to grow and for a natural looking cervical contour.[10] Also check out how to plan for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484712">alveolar ridge preservation in the esthetic zone</a>.[11]  </p>

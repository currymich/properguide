      <h6 class="heading">The butt joint for ceramic veneer incisal preparation</h6>
      <p>Feather edge? Palatal chamfer? Butt joint? It is nice to have data when making decisions about which preparation is best for maintaining the tooth’s strength and avoiding ceramic fracture. In a review of the literature, researchers found the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304908">butt joint was the all-around best incisal preparation for ceramic veneers</a>, as it left the tooth with high strength, while the palatal chamfer carried a higher risk of ceramic fracture.

      <h6 class="heading">Interruption of anticoagulation therapy for dental surgery</h6>
      <p>In our aging population, patients are frequently on anticoagulation therapy. While you may want to avoid bleeding complications in your chair, or later in your patient’s home, embolic complications are typically much more serious. In an article an JADA this month, Dr. Wahl reports that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304913"> bleeding complications for these patients “have been rare and never fatal” while some embolic complications have been “fatal and others possibly permanently debilitating”</a>. This article calls for a shift in practice towards keeping patients on anticoagulation therapy for most surgeries. [2]  In making your decision make sure you know the current guidelines and the patients’ medications and labs. And, of course, always work with your patient’s physician.  </p>

      <h6 class="heading">Bleaching agents with H2O2 concentrations above 15% </h6>
      <p>Researchers from Brazil set out to determine whether tooth bleaching is as benign as it is perceived to be. They found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304422">concentrations of peroxide above 15% (they tested 25 and 35% solutions) do not bleach the teeth more effectively and actually cause some adverse effects</a> (e.g. sensitivity, reduced enamel hardness, and alterations in surface morphology) [3].  In a separate study on the effect on composite resins, all bleaching concentrations (from 10-22%) caused <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303753"> decreased “microhardness of methacrylate-based composite resin[s]”</a> [4].  So, perhaps the popular 25% and 35% varieties are not such a good idea for your patients. </p>

      <h6 class="heading">Metformin as a regenerative endodontic therapy</h6>
      <p>The popular drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes was shown by researchers from the University of Maryland to have the potential to cause <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29306537"> differentiation and mineralization of dental pulp cells</a>, at least in vitro [5].  They expected this outcome due to the fact that Metformin regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. This could be a promising finding for the field of regenerative endodontics.</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Teledentistry</h6>
      <p>As in seeing patients on a screen rather than face-to-face. Defined in 1989, teledentistry is emerging as an option for remote, isolated, or resource-poor areas. It is also useful for nursing homes or patients with limited mobility. In a review of the literature, researchers from Old Dominion University in Virginia found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303678"> teledentistry was a promising option for oral screening</a>, diagnosis, and referral of patients when needed.[6]  </p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Bariatric surgery is associated with a higher caries rate</h6>
      <p>In the world of hospital dentistry, we routinely examine and educate patients about oral changes and caries prevention prior to head and neck radiation, chemotherapy, cardiac surgery, joint surgery, organ transplants, and bisphosphonate therapy. Perhaps we should add bariatric surgery to this list, as it effects the entire digestive track, including the oral cavity, leading to saliva changes, acid reflux, and dietary changes. In a review of the literature, researchers from Spain found that patients do indeed have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304473"> higher rate of caries following bariatric surgery </a>[7].  What’s the solution? Education about diet and hygiene for caries prevention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">How much radiation patients get from a CBCT to examine impacted canines</h6>
      <p>While it’s nice to have a 3D representation of an impacted canine prior to exposing and bonding or extracting it, radiation dose is an issue. Researchers from Sweden and Norway compared radiation doses from the ProMax3D and the NewTom5G to various combinations of panoramic and periapical radiographs. The results are worth noting: NewTom5G <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303367">CBCT caused 140 times higher radiation dose than two periapical radiographs. </a> [8]  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Diet may be more important than hygiene in caries risk of pre-school children</h6>
      <p>Contaminate less or clean more? The answer tends to be the former. Researchers in Scotland found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29301042"> sugar consumption and snacking habits were more predictive of caries risk than hygiene habits</a> in children under five. [9] This is not surprising as sugar snacking leads to a feast for bacteria, leading to lower pH and thriving bacterial colonies. The toothbrush is no match for this complex microscopic ecosystem. </p>

<!--             THINGS TO TRY            -->

  <div class="section">
    <h5 class="heading">Things to try in your practice</h5>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">The Two-Window Technique without Membrane for Maxillary Sinus Augmentation</h6>
      <p>In a severely atrophic posterior maxilla with multiple missing teeth, bone augmentation for implant placement is a challenge. Researchers from the Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology in Beijing<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29034598"> compared bone formation in a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the two-window lateral wall technique without membrane coverage </a> to the larger, single-window technique with membrane coverage and found comparable volume of grafted bone [1]. The advantages of the two-window technique include avoidance of fracture of the maxillary sinus septa and smaller overall window volume to achieve the same grafted volume. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Implant Crowns with Emergence Profiles ≤30 Degrees</h6>
      <p>It turns out the accuracy of implant placement location is important for avoiding peri-implantitis, another reason to reach for a surgical guide when in doubt. Researchers from the University of Washington studied 168 implants and found very high levels (almost 40%) of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28985447">peri-implantitis for bone-level implants with convex profile and emergence angle >30 degrees </a>[2]. So, if your implant is too far away from that adjacent tooth, the resulting over-contoured crown will be a problem.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Smoking Cessation Programs</h6>
      <p>Smoking negatively affects lives…through periodontal disease. Researchers in Germany set out to assess a tricky metric: “the smoking-attributable burden of periodontal disease”. We all know smoking causes disability and decreases quality and length of life. What we didn’t know was that this can be quantified by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) specifically for smoking-attributable periodontal disease. They calculated that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28965352" > global smoking-attributable burden was 251,160 DALYs.</a> Another way of looking at the global burden is that there are 38.5 million cases of smoking-attributable periodontal disease [3]. If this isn’t compelling enough, it also turns out the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29033092"> dental pulps of smokers are immunologically deficient,</a> leading to worse endodontic prognosis, according to researchers from Case School of Dental Medicine [4]. So, incorporating smoking cessation into your practice may have a larger impact than you thought.</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Screening Patients for Chronic Diseases</h6>
      <p>Mounting evidence suggests dental offices could effectively screen for undiagnosed chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Researchers in New York found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29023928"> almost a third of the population without health insurance saw their dentist,</a> but not their primary care doctor, in a one year period. By screening patients for risk factors or symptoms of systemic disease, oral health care providers may be able to aid in reducing the burden of chronic disease [5].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Early Placement of Implants</h6>
      <p>Researchers from the University of Bologna in Italy set out to determine whether timing affects marginal bone loss two years after implant placement. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28945667"> They found that early placement (8-12 weeks after extraction) preserved the marginal bone better </a>than immediate or delayed placement (10-12 months) in a prospective study of 131 implants [6]. </p>

      <h6 class="heading">Immediately Loaded Single Implants in the Edentulous Mandible</h6>
      <p>While short cuts are always tempting, researchers in Germany have found one you may want to avoid in your practice. In a randomized controlled trial of single median mandibular implants to support implant overdentures, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045800"> immediate loading caused worse survival rates than delayed loading,</a> with 9 out of 81 implants failing in the first 3 months of loading [7]. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Drilling of “Suspicious” Occlusal Carious Lesions</h6>
      <p>Deciding when to drill out suspicious grooves is controversial and varies from office to office. The National Dental Practice-Based Research Network set out to provide some consensus. In a large study involving 93 dentists and 1593 suspicious occlusal carious lesions (based on surface roughness, opacity, or staining), <a href="http://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(17)30712-2/pdf">39% of the lesions were found to be inactive or not involving dentin when opened.</a> Their ultimate recommendation is to consider “evidence-based preventive management” rather than surgical intervention for suspicious occlusal carious lesions [8]. </p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Periodontal Regeneration using Chitosan</h6>
      <p>You may remember chitin as the crunchy outer layer of shrimp. Chitosan is derived from chitin and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045803"> shows promise for use as a scaffold in regeneration </a> of multiple types of periodontal tissues in mouse research conducted by scientists and engineers in Italy and Canada [9].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Artificial biomaterial implants for repair of alveolar bone defects</h6>
      <p>While bone harvested from various sources (hip, fibula) is often used to repair large alveolar bone defects from trauma, infection, or tumor resection, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29020507"> 3D printed bioceramic scaffolds </a> may prove an attractive alternative. Researchers in China tested a 10% Mg-substituted wollastonite (CSi-Mg10) scaffold and other bioceramic materials, 3D printed, with similar 3D architecture to bone, and with the exact shape of the mandibular defect in rabbits. Their results were promising [10].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">A New Class of Dental Ceramics</h6>
      <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28977778">Submicron grain-sized alumina performed well in mechanical and esthetic properties.</a> Researchers from New York University School of Dentistry and Shanghai Institute of Ceramics found these had higher strength than cubic-containing zirconia and lithia-based glass ceramics and translucency similar to currently available high-translucency porcelains [11].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">High-frequency Vibration to Accelerate Orthodontic Tooth Movement</h6>
      <p>Results published in Nature show, in rats, that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13541-7"> high-frequency vibration coupled with a static force accelerated tooth movement </a>in fixed appliance orthodontic therapy when used at an optimum frequency and magnitude of force [12].</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">When Lower Third Molars will be Very Difficult to Extract</h6>
      <p>Researchers in Naples, Italy, proposed and tested a new scale of difficulty for lower third molar extractions, which considers the angulation, available space, depth, bone density, relation with the canal, buccolingual position, and dental morphology. Five oral surgeons performed extractions on 200 patients classified clinically and radiographically by a sixth oral surgeon, and high concordance was found between their assessments using this scale [13]. You can read the details <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026643561730685X">here</a> and apply the scale prior to deciding whether to tackle your next lower third molar procedure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Whether to Use Cover Screws or Healing Abutments</h6>
      <p>It may not matter, at least for non-molar implants. Researchers from University Complutense of Madrid randomized 30 patients to receive transmucosal abutments or cover screws for bone-level implants in non-molar positions and, after five years of follow up, found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29032574">100% success overall and no significant differences</a> in crestal bone levels, peri-implantitis, or patient satisfaction [14]. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">The Evidence for Risk of Systemic Disease with Periodontal Disease Mounts</h6>
      <p>There is now an epidemiologic link between pneumonia death and periodontal disease in patients on hemodialysis. As expected, over 40% of the enrolled adult patients had periodontal disease at the beginning of this 7-year prospective cohort study of 211 patients on hemodialysis. Statistically accounting for other comorbidities, researchers in Japan found the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28985442"> risk of death from pneumonia was still substantially greater for patients with periodontal disease </a> [15].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Oral Microbes May Contribute to Bowel Disease</h6>
      <p>As is true of many oral diseases, the autoimmune diseases of the gut, including inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease are associated with microbial dysbiosis. Tricky-to-treat <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6361/316.4"> Klebsiella species seem particularly to blame,</a> and an article published in Science says they probably come from the mouth [16].</p>

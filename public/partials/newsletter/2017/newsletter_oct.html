    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) for sinus membrane perforation repair</h6>
      <p>Maxillary sinus perforation is a frequent side effect of sinus lift procedures. In a retrospective study, researchers in Turkey showed that at least 10 cases of sinus perforations from lateral wall sinus lifts were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28857405">successfully repaired with PRF</a>, and 100% implant survival was achieved [1]. These findings were corroborated by a study in New Zealand rabbits showing no difference histologically between sinus membranes repaired with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28596050">collagen membranes versus PRF</a> [2].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Titanium-zirconium narrow diameter implants</h6>
      <p>Implant dentistry involves many decisions, one of which being whether to do more invasive surgery to augment narrow ridges, or pre-operative orthodontics to expand mesiodistal spaces, rather than choosing narrow diameter implants. One of the drawbacks of narrow implants is that they have lower mechanical strength. Researchers from the University of Sao Paulo, School of Dentistry conducted a review of the literature to answer whether the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28853215">titanium-zirconium alloy implants</a>, which have increased tensile strength, also have similar success rates, and peri-implant bone resorption, as traditional pure titanium implants. Good news: they do [3].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Sinus floor elevation without bone grafts</h6>
      <p>In the rapidly changing field of implant dentistry, it is refreshing to find something has stood the test of time. Researchers from from Vastervik Hospital and Linkoping University Hospital in Sweden found 31 out of 34 implants placed simultaneously with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28853214">osteotome sinus floor elevation without bone grafts</a> lasted through the 10-year mark, with the 3 failures occurring in the first 3 years, in completely edentulous patients [4]. Similar success was found for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28853203"> transcrestal sinus floor augmentation with immediate implant placement</a> in fresh extraction sockets by researchers from West China Hospital of Stomatology [5]. A group of researchers from Italy, Spain, and California agree that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940603">implants placed at time of sinus lift without bone grafting work well</a> and achieve great vertical bone augmentation [6].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Non-surgical therapy for peri-implantitis</h6>
      <p>Peri-implantitis is a troubling and difficult to treat. Researchers from Germany successfully implemented a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28914597"> non-surgical protocol for peri-implantitis treatment</a> in 164 implants with promising results. Their technique involves the following: ultrasonic debridement, soft tissue curettage, glycine powder air polishing, and submucosal Povidone-iodine. They tried adding systemic antibiotics in some cases, but with limited effect [7].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Closed maxillary ridge augmentation</h6>
      <p>There are many ways to approach the issue of inadequate horizontal bone in the anterior maxilla for implant placement. The less-traumatic, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886354"> closed tunnel approach </a>may offer advantages according to researchers in Louisiana private practice [8].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Minimizing implant abutment changes</h6>
      <p>Working towards the goal of minimizing marginal bone loss, researchers in Italy reviewed the literature to determine whether <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923270">definitive implant abutments </a>may solve this problem. Definitive abutments are placed at the time of implant placement and are never disconnected, which contrasts with the typical process of removing and changing abutments multiple times prior to the final restoration. From the 14 studies they reviewed, marginal bone loss and buccal recession were lower with definitive abutments [9]. Another option for minimizing abutment changes is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940709">Encode protocol</a> [10].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Patient-Centered Care</h6>
      <p>Our physician colleagues have already worked this out, and our patients have grown to expect it, so how do we implement <a href="https://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v223/n6/full/sj.bdj.2017.806.html">patient-centered care in dentistry?</a> Research shows that by focusing on the three principles of “humility, hospitality and mindfulness” in our clinical process of “connecting, examining, sharing, and intervening” we will be well on our way [11].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Decreasing your use of antibiotics</h6>
      <p>Antibiotics are frequently prescribed by dentists, often as a prophylactic measure post-extraction to presumably prevent infectious complications. However, it is well known that the individual and public health complications of antibiotic overuse are serious. Researchers from the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain, randomized 293 patients to receive anti-inflammatory and analgesic medication with or without antibiotics following third molar extraction and found that, while pain and swelling were reduced in the antibiotic group, there were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28936293"> no clear medical justifications for routine use </a>, considering the risks [12]. Similarly, researchers from the Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil, concluded that clinical intervention (e.g. drainage) for odontogenic infection is more important than the choice of antibiotics. They also concluded that when antibiotics are necessary for systemic or regional manifestations, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893540">they should be used for the shortest time possible </a> and stopped when “clinical cure is achieved” [13].</p>

    <h5 class="heading">Things to keep your eye on</h5>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Enamel Regeneration</h6>
      <p>The future of dentistry clearly holds more than drilling and filling. A group of researchers from the University of Greifswald, Germany, tried adding the oligopeptide P11-4 to fluoride varnish and studied it in a randomized controlled single-blind study on caries in children. P11-4 is made of amino acids and has been shown to build a bio-matrix for hydroxyapatite formation. At least in children, this study is convincing in providing P11-4 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28892645">enhanced fluoride varnish as a non-invasive alternative for caries treatment</a> and was shown to be safe and significantly more effective than fluoride varnish alone [14].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Implants with Surface Coatings</h6>
      <p>Researchers from the University of Rochester and King Saud University in Saudi Arabia investigated whether osteogenic coatings promoted bone-to-implant contact in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28767464"> osteoporotic bone</a>. While five studies reviewed showed the coatings helped and only one showed no difference, the authors concluded the clinical relevance is not yet clear [15]. In further investigations into implant coatings, researchers from Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia considered antimicrobial coatings. The authors explored studies with various <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922615"> antimicrobial coating </a>strategies and discussed the pros and cons [16]. Stay tuned.</p>

<!--          THINGS TO KNOW SECTION                -->


  <div class="section">
    <h5 class="heading">Things to know</h5>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">The link between oral and systemic disease grows stronger</h6>
      <p>Not surprisingly, there is mounting evidence that bacteria under your gums may be bad for your overall health. Research this month strengthens the association between periodontal disease and asthma [17], obesity [18], dyslipidemia [19], and the prevalence of comorbidities (particularly allergies, hypertension, musculoskeletal disorders, and endocrine disorders) [20]. There is also increasing evidence that endodontic lesions are bad for you: apical pathology causes oxidative stress locally and systemically [21]. Floss, floss, floss.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Genetic factors influencing oral bacteria may not be so important</h6>
      <p>Patients often blame the state of their teeth on genetics. Researchers from California, Maryland, and Australia did a large study of twin children to determine how much genetics affects the oral microbiota and caries. While they did find heritable bacteria, they were not of the cariogenic sort and became less prevalent throughout childhood, leading the authors to conclude that caries were more environmentally influenced (sugar intake influenced progression to cariogenic bacteria) [22]. Another group of researchers considered vertical transmission of periodontal pathogens and found these were correlated between children and mothers (likely not through genetics) and were not affected by diet [23]. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Orthodontic mini-implants deteriorate after 6 months</h6>
      <p>Researchers from Egypt and Saudi Arabia studied 72 orthodontic mini-implants retrieved from patients and found enough evidence of deterioration to recommend limiting their use to less than 6 months [24].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">It may be possible to diagnose Zika Virus in using saliva samples</h6>
      <p>By analyzing saliva of a mother infected with Zika virus in her first trimester and saliva of her twin babies, 3 months after birth, researchers from Canada and Brazil found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28825520">Zika virus peptides present in the saliva </a> of all three individuals. What’s more? Only one of the babies had microcephaly and was found to have many more unique Zika virus peptides than her brother, who was born healthy. Many questions remain, including whether saliva could be a useful diagnostic tool, as well as whether the virus could be transmitted through saliva, long after the acute disease resolves [25].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">To flap or not to flap in implant dentistry; turns out, maybe it doesn’t matter</h6>
      <p>Of course, the decision to raise a flap prior to placing your implant is and should be driven by the need for soft (keratinized) tissue and bone management. The good news is, at least in dog mandibles, either choice gives you the same outcomes for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846560"> stability and osseointegration </a> of the implant according to researchers from Chosun University in Korea [26].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">New anti-thrombotic agents may affect your practice</h6>
      <p>Keeping up with all the latest anti-coagulant therapies may be daunting, but so is an unexpected bleeding event in your chair. The list currently includes vitamin K antagonists (Coumadin), direct factor Xa inhibitors (Xarelto, Eliquis), heparins (Lovenox), direct thrombin (IIa) inhibitors (Pradaxa), fibrinolytics (Streptokinase), glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (Abciximab), ADP receptor/P2Y12 inhibitors (Plavix), prostaglandin analogues (Prostacyclin), COX inhibitors (Aspirin), thromboxane inhibitors (Cardoxin), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Pletal), and so on. To confuse us more, there are multiple drugs in each class. What to do? Stay up to date by reading reviews, such as the one this month from researchers from The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, to identify patients on anti-thrombotic agents, and arm yourself with local hemostatic agents, such as SURGICEL SNoW™ and various others on the market. In addition, confirm hemostasis prior to letting your patient go home [27].</p>

    <h5 class="heading">Fun facts</h5>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Mosasaurs and snakes have a PDL</h6>
      <p>You may or may not know that mammals and crocodilians (crocodiles, alligators, caimans) have been thought to be the only animals with a periodontal ligament. The absence of a PDL in other reptiles and birds (whose teeth are ankylosed) have led to the belief that the PDL in crocodilians evolved convergently with that in mammals (implying it was not of the same origin). This theory has come under scrutiny in recent decades. Researchers from the University of Alberta, Canada, further challenged this notion by showing that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28901023">snakes and mosasaurs do have a PDL</a>, it just calcifies early [28].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Facial aesthetics norms may be overrated</h6>
      <p>Clinicians rely on facial profile aesthetics norms in their treatment. Researchers from Macedonia, Croatia, and Slovenia studied the psychosocial impact of deviations from the norms. While they found some evidence of association between deviations in certain facial characteristics and patients’ awareness of the characteristic, they found the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886894">impact on psychosocial issues was low </a> overall [29]. The moral is, if your patient, their partner, and their mom are all happy with the way they look, maybe you should be too.</p>

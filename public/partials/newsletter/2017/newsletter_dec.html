    <h5 class="heading">Things to try in your practice</h5>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">An undersized drilling protocol with sinus augmentation for implant placement in low-density bone</h6>
      <p>As you know, under-preparation of the osteotomy is recommended in low-density bone, such as that in the posterior maxilla. A study, conducted by researchers in Italy, followed 253 implants for 60 months or more to determine whether under-drilling combined with sinus augmentation in the posterior maxilla could be performed with high success in low-density sites with differing residual bone heights. This method (specifically a 12.5% undersized drilling protocol) proved <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164788">as successful for sites with more versus less than 4mm residual bone height </a>[1]. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Screening for low bone mineral density</h6>
      <p>Every visit to your practice is an opportunity to pick up clues your patient may need medical attention. Researchers in Brazil have identified panoramic radiographs as a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29179241"> potential screening tool for deficient bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. </a> They determined the accuracy was high enough, when compared to radiographs from other bones in the body, to allow for referral for proper evaluation and treatment [2]. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Custom Morse taper zirconia abutments</h6>
      <p>Customized zirconia abutments are very aesthetic, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29179039">does customization affect marginal fit and torque loss?</a> Researchers from Brazil and the US suggest it does not [3].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Near-infrared light transillumination (NILT) for detection of interproximal caries</h6>
      <p>Bitewing radiographs have been the standard for detection of interproximal caries, but emerging methods for detection without ionizing radiation, such as NILT, may be promising alternatives. In fact, researchers from Turkey found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5689175/"> NILT was as effective as bitewings</a> in detecting early interproximal carious lesions [4].</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Socket shields?</h6>
      <p>Management of the bone and soft tissue during implant placement in the esthetic zone is a challenge. The concept of socket-shielding, or retaining a buccal root segment, has been around for years. Researchers from South Africa and Georgia looked at 128 socket-shield cases with immediate implant placement for four years follow-up. While <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29178381">survival rate was 96.1%, complication rate was 19.5%... </a>[5]. </p>

      <h6 class="heading">Treatment of periodontitis with NFB decoy by ultrasound microbubble</h6>
      <p>The point is, mechanical debridement of subgingival biofilms is not optimal to effectively treat periodontitis. The current paradigm shift is towards immunological interventions to halt the host’s immune cell activation. Researchers in Japan show that by introducing an NFB decoy oligodeoxynucleotide into rat gingival tissues, they were able to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665421/">successfully reduce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</a> As NFB is a key transcription factor in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, this decoy’s selective blockade of NFB’s function makes it a contender for successful treatment of the disease and its systemic consequences [6]. </p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">The various modifications of titanium implant surfaces may affect osteoblast activity</h6>
      <p>Between acid-etching, machine surfacing, alumina-blasting, and hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate grit-blasting, it is hard to keep up with all of the surface modifications performed on titanium implants. Researchers in Poland got us one step closer by studying the in vitro effects of these different treatments and their combinations on osteoblastic activity. Their results put <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29179009"> alumina and hydroxyapatite blasting on the top of the list</a> for their “slightly” higher effects on osteoblast differentiation. In vivo studies are the next step [7].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Periodontal intervention is particularly important in patients with chronic kidney disease</h6>
      <p>So much so that there is a fancy acronym for the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5683458/">INfluence of Successful Periodontal Intervention in REnal Disease </a>(INSPIRED). As both chronic kidney disease and periodontitis are associated with systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, researchers in the UK are working on a pilot clinical trial to quantify the effects of oral treatment in this patient population; stay tuned [8]. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">…and Alzheimer’s</h6>
      <p>Researchers in Japan, using a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673943/">higher levels of Amiloid β deposition in the brains of mice inoculated orally with P. gingivalis.</a> Not only did these mice experience alveolar bone loss, but they also had impaired cognitive function and greater levels of IL-1β and TNF in their brains. How does this all happen? The endotoxin LPS from P. gingivalis crosses the blood brain barrier and wreaks havoc on pro-inflammatory immune cell processes in the brain [9].   </p>

      <h6 class="heading">The skinny on where we are with dental implants today</h6>
      <p>There are myriad decisions to make for every implant you place (immediate versus conventional loading, short versus long implants, various surface coatings, etc.), each one backed by either a surplus or a dearth of scientific studies. Researchers from Korea set out to summarize the state of our knowledge today as well as to discuss recent advances. You can read their summary <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5671421/">here</a> [10].</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Peri-implantitis and bone loss could be related to metal particle release</h6>
      <p>Peri-implantitis is prevalent and troubling for patients and providers. The cause is still to be determined. In a mini-review, researchers from New York, Michigan, and Germany explore <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29130804"> metal particle release as a possible cause </a>[11].</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Patients who do not visit their dentist regularly have worse cardiometabolic health</h6>
      <p>Not surprisingly, deferred dental care during adolescence and early adulthood is associated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29173332"> with worse cardiometabolic health indicators</a> in a large-scale study [12].</p>

      <p>In the spirit of bringing awareness of the importance of oral health, the Academic Dental building of the University of Riau in Indonesia is being designed with a Contextual Architecture approach <a href="https://jom.unri.ac.id/index.php/JOMFTEKNIK/article/view/17090/16503">based on tooth formation and tooth patterns </a>[13]. </p>

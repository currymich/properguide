      <h6 class="heading">Immediately loaded, reduced-diameter implants to support mandibular dentures</h6>
      <p>Those thin mandibular ridges in edentulous patients can be challenging for patients with impossible-to-fit, loose dentures, as well as for practitioners who don’t see enough bone to place implants. Prosthodontic researchers from the University of Würzburg and the University of Heidelberg suggest the answer is reduced-diameter implants with locator-analog attachments. What’s more? You can load them immediately and still achieve a <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28440024">98% success rate and very happy patients</a>, at least for this study’s one-year period of follow up [1].</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF)</h6>
      <p>This form of topical fluoride has been shown to predictably arrest active carious lesions into dentin, unlike the many other forms of topical fluoride on the market. It is now widely used, particularly to arrest childhood caries and geriatric root caries. However, the chemical mechanism of this compound’s caries arresting properties and its ability to incorporate into the tooth’s mineral structure has only just been unfolded.  Researchers, including experts in dentistry and chemistry, from the University of Hong Kong and the University of Edinburgh teamed up to get to the bottom of SDF’s success. They found that, in vitro, <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28521107">the calcium and phosphate ions in saliva join with SDF to form fluorohydroxyapatite </a>[2], which is less soluble in the caries-forming acid from bacteria. What’s the downside? SDF turns the caries black, permanently.</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) in Extraction Sockets of Patients on Oral Bisphosphonates</h6>
      <p>Despite the risk of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), we do occasionally have to perform extractions on the many patients who take oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis. Researchers from the Hokkaido University Graduate School of Dental Medicine in Japan found significantly <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27837344">decreased rates of delayed healing when they placed PRF in the extraction sockets </a>compared to their controls without PRF [3]. While in this sample of 102, none of the patients developed MRONJ, the decreased incidence of delayed healing is promising enough to consider this treatment in your practice, particularly if you already own a centrifuge.</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Lasers to decrease enamel erosion</h6>
      <p>Lasers are new and shiny and seem to have many applications in dentistry. The latest? Increasing resistance to enamel erosion. For now this has not been tested in vivo, but on cows’ teeth, researchers from RWTH Aachen University and the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology achieved a whopping 600°C temperature increase at the enamel and only 2°C increase at the pulp with their laser technology. They then found when subjected to cycles of erosion, <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28665779">the enamel of the laser-treated teeth eroded 64% less </a>[4].</p>

      <h6 class="heading">Lasers to treat Periodontitis</h6>
      <p>While lasers have proven their worth for the treatment of many conditions, the jury’s still out regarding their use in treatment of periodontitis. In a review of 118 studies by a researcher from the University of Missouri-Kansas City, <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28758295">he could not conclude that lasers offer any advantage over traditional treatments for periodontal disease </a>[5]. While he cites many inconsistencies and limitations of the literature to-date and the need for improved studies, this lack of a clear advantage for using lasers in this context may give you pause when considering investing in the next laser model to treat periodontitis in your practice.</p>

    <h5 class="heading">Things to know</h5>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Our immune system is to blame for the progression of periodontal disease</h6>
      <p>Dental clinicians and researchers agree that without bacteria (particularly gram negative anaerobic bacteria with endotoxin) there would be no periodontal disease. What’s less well-known is that this disease also would not exist without the destruction caused by our own immune systems after being activated by this endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). One team of researchers describes this phenomenon as the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28758303">“periodontal war” between bacteria and our own immune system </a>[6]: when our own immune cells are activated by gram negative bacteria (LPS binds to surface receptors activating a pro-inflammatory process), they initiate a process of tissue and bone breakdown creating a subgingival nidus for infection by more anaerobes, and the cycle continues. Another research team recommends we control the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28758299"> disease by targeting the inflammatory process </a>[7]; if our immune system stops destructing tissue, the bacteria will lose its cozy subgingival home.</p>

      <h6 class="heading">When to pull out the surgical guide for implant surgery</h6>
      <p>Of course guided implant surgery is more likely to get your implant in the location you want than free-handing it. However, clinicians are not always using guides due to cost, time, and individual preference. Researchers from Stanford have studied the accuracy of over 450 free-hand implants to give you a clue as to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28731896"> when it’s most important to spring for the surgical guide</a>, including when there are not teeth on both sides, when more than one implant is being placed next to one another, and when you have only been placing implants for a couple of years [8].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Childhood obesity affects dental health</h6>
      <p>While we know that genetics plays a role in timing of permanent molar eruption, researchers from the University of North Carolina found that <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28644755">higher BMI can speed up eruption by 6-12 months </a>[9]. Why should we care? The answer is that earlier eruption of permanent molars is associated with higher caries risk, and sealants may be considered too late in programs targeting children of a specific age.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Osteoporosis may increase bone loss around implants</h6>
      <p>Marginal bone loss around implants is a pesky problem we all want to avoid as much as possible, particularly in the esthetic zone. Researchers from the Medical University of Vienna looked at multiple factors which may contribute to marginal bone loss in women with implants (e.g. time, smoking, plaque, bisphosphonates, prosthesis type, placing the implant below bone level, etc.) and found <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28480634">osteoporosis as an independent predictor of marginal bone loss </a>[10]. While they do not suggest osteoporosis as a contraindication for implant placement, clinicians may want to expect more bone loss in these patients and plan accordingly.</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Viruses may play a role in oral mucositis during chemoradiation for cancer</h6>
      <p>In addition to being very painful, mucositis during chemoradiation treatment for head and neck cancers can interfere with treatment and lead to the use of feeding tubes if patients are in too much pain to eat. The more we know about this condition, the closer we will get to treating it effectively. Researchers from the University of São Paulo in Brazil looked into the role of viruses in the condition and found various herpesviruses were shed in the saliva of patients undergoing chemoradiation, with <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27966015">Epstein Barr Virus  (EBV) shedding being associated with the severity of mucositis</a> [11]. Stay tuned, this may lead to some increased insight and, hopefully, improved treatment strategies.</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">Fossil teeth lead to questioning of when modern humans left Africa</h6>
      <p>We know teeth are important for quality of life, but paleoanthropologists also use them to piece together history. Human teeth from a rainforest cave in Sumatra, an island in Western Indonesia, date Anatomically Modern Human (AMH) occupation there earlier than ever thought before. By looking at tooth morphology (e.g. enamel thickness, enamel-dentin junction morphology) an international team of researchers confirms the teeth are from AMH, and <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28792933">modern dating methods age the teeth at 73 to 63 thousand years old. </a>This, coupled with other environmental evidence suggests AMH may have left Africa much earlier than we thought [12].</p>

    <div class="article">
      <h6 class="heading">There is increasing evidence of paleo-dentistry</h6>
      <p>Hunter-gatherer dentists? While evidence of dental pathology is much more prevalent in Neolithic societies with farming, an international team of researchers reports evidence of an early form of root canal treatment performed 13,000 years ago in a <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28345756">Paleolithic hunter-gatherer with enlarged and filled pulp chambers in both maxillary central incisors </a>[13]. As amazing as this is, the evidence found in Krapina, Croatia of Neanderthal dentistry may be even more surprising. Researchers from the United States and Croatia found evidence of <a href="https://href.li/?https://hrcak.srce.hr/183221">dental manipulation to treat eruption abnormalities in around a 40,000-year-old Neanderthal mandible.</a></p>
